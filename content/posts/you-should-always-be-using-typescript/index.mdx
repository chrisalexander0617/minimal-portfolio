During my career as a non-traditional software engineer. I've worked on many projects, large and small andI have come to realize that there is no real structure on how to build software.
Everyone has their own way of doing things and no answer is explicitly right or wrong. Working with multiple developers on large scale teams adds a lot of complexity to a project
and if there is no structure to your code base or how you build out your modules, your software product can turn into a really mess that no one will want to work on. You'll spend
more time fixing bugs than building the actual feature.

## Typescript is a nasty pill you swallow that will make you feel alot better later on

I'll admit that I avoided typescript for a while before embracing it into my workflow. I looked at it like a red light signal when there are no cars on the road.

Absolutely pointless!...at first.

For a small project with a few components you can get away with plain old javascript but when you start building something very
important that has a lot of business logic infused into your solution, things can get very messy quick. I've recently completed a small project, which is a small
fullstack app that displayed carbon emissions data on a react frontend using node and typescript. Using typescript and creating interfaces for my components allowed me
to build this application very quickly. When bugs popped up, fixing them became very easy because the strict typing blocks a lot of the errors before they even appear.
When working work multiple developers with different coding styles and educational backgrounds, its important for everyone to follow a guideline that will help everyone
deliver products and features faster with less hiccups.
